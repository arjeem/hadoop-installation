For example, if the name of your private key file is `big-data.pem`, use the following command:<br>\r\n\r\n    chmod 400 big-data.pem\r\n\r\nUse the ssh command to connect to the instance. You'll specify the private key `(.pem)` file and `user_name@public_dns_name`. For Ubuntu, the username is ubuntu. \r\n    ssh -i big-data.pem ubuntu@ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com\r\n\r\nYou'll see a response like the following.\r\n    The authenticity of host 'ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com (10.254.142.33)' can't be established.\r\n    RSA key fingerprint is 1f:51:ae:28:bf:89:e9:d8:1f:25:5d:37:2d:7d:b8:ca:9f:f5:f1:6f.\r\n    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?\r\n\r\n(Optional) Verify that the fingerprint in the security alert matches the fingerprint that you obtained in step 1. If these fingerprints don't match, someone might be attempting a \"man-in-the-middle\" attack. If they match, continue to the next step.\r\nEnter yes.\r\nYou'll see a response like the following.\r\n    Warning: Permanently added 'ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com' (RSA) \r\nto the list of known hosts.\r\n\r\nReference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
