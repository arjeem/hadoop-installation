{"name":"Single Node Hadoop installation on Ubuntu 14.04 Amazon EC2 Instance","tagline":"hadoop installation, wordcount, ubuntu 14.04, amazon instance","body":"# Create the Amazon EC2 Instance (Ubuntu 14.04)\r\n\r\n## To connect your Amazon EC2 instance using SSH from your local machine (Ubuntu)\r\n\r\nIn a command line shell, change directories to the location of the private key file that you created when you launched the instance. <br>\r\nUse the chmod command to make sure your private key file isn't publicly viewable. For example, if the name of your private key file is `big-data.pem`, use the following command:<br>\r\n\r\n    chmod 400 big-data.pem\r\n\r\nUse the ssh command to connect to the instance. You'll specify the private key `(.pem)` file and `user_name@public_dns_name`. For Ubuntu, the username is ubuntu. \r\n    ssh -i big-data.pem ubuntu@ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com\r\n\r\nYou'll see a response like the following.\r\n\r\n    The authenticity of host 'ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com (10.254.142.33)' can't be established.\r\n    RSA key fingerprint is 1f:51:ae:28:bf:89:e9:d8:1f:25:5d:37:2d:7d:b8:ca:9f:f5:f1:6f.\r\n    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?\r\n\r\n(Optional) Verify that the fingerprint in the security alert matches the fingerprint that you obtained in step 1. If these fingerprints don't match, someone might be attempting a \"man-in-the-middle\" attack. If they match, continue to the next step.\r\nEnter `yes`.\r\nYou'll see a response like the following.\r\n\r\n    Warning: Permanently added 'ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com' (RSA) \r\nto the list of known hosts.\r\n\r\nReference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html\r\n\r\n## Installation of Single Node Hadoop cluster on Ubuntu 14.04 Amazon EC2 Instance\r\n\r\n### Install Java\r\nYou need to install java by following commands as,\r\n\r\n    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java\r\n    $ sudo apt-get update\r\n    $ sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer\r\n    # Update Java runtime\r\n    $ sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-7-oracle\r\n\r\nTo check whether your java is installed or not,\r\n\r\n    $ java -version\r\n\r\n### Disabling IPv6\r\nTo disable `ipv6`, you have to open `/etc/sysctl.conf` using any text editor and insert the following lines at the end:\r\n\r\n    net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1\r\n    net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1\r\n    net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1\r\n\r\nIf `ipv6` is still not disabled, then the problem is that `sysctl.conf` is still not activated.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, open a terminal(Ctrl+Alt+T) and type the command,\r\n\r\n    $ sudo sysctl -p\r\n\r\nYou will see this in the terminal:\r\n\r\n    net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1\r\n    net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1\r\n    net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1\r\n\r\nAfter that, if you run:\r\n\r\n    $ cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6\r\n\r\nIt will report:\r\n\r\n    1\r\n\r\n### Install Hadoop 2.6.0 stable binaries\r\n\r\nInstall the hadoop binary and then install it on the home folder itself.\r\n\r\n    $ cd\r\n    $ wget http://mirrors.sonic.net/apache/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.6.0/hadoop-2.6.0.tar.gz\r\n    $ tar xvf hadoop-2.6.0.tar.gz\r\n    $ mv hadoop-2.6.0 hadoop\r\n\r\n\r\n### Create and Setup SSH Certificates\r\nTo create the ssh key, we create the following command as,\r\n\r\n    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -P \"\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    Generating public/private rsa key pair.\r\n    Enter file in which to save the key (/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa): \r\n    Created directory '/home/ubuntu/.ssh'.\r\n    Your identification has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.\r\n    Your public key has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.\r\n    The key fingerprint is:\r\n    50:6b:f3:fc:0f:32:bf:30:79:c2:41:71:26:cc:7d:e3 ubuntu@laptop\r\n    The key's randomart image is:\r\n    +--[ RSA 2048]----+\r\n    |        .oo.o    |\r\n    |       . .o=. o  |\r\n    |      . + .  o . |\r\n    |       o =    E  |\r\n    |        S +      |\r\n    |         . +     |\r\n    |          O +    |\r\n    |           O o   |\r\n    |            o..  |\r\n    +-----------------+\r\n\r\n\r\nYou need to copy the key to the `authorized_keys`,\r\n\r\n    $ cat $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys\r\n\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
